## About me
My name is Jui-Chien Tsou, but you can call me Eric. I am currently an undergraduate student studying computer science at National Taiwan University, expecting to graduate in June 2026. My research focuses on parallel programming, HPC, and LLMs.

You can find my CV [here](files/cv.pdf).
