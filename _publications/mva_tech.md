## Abstract:
Small Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT) is particularly challenging when targets occupy only a few dozen pixels, rendering detection and appearance-based association unreliable. Building on the success of the MVA2023 SOD4SB challenge, this paper introduces the SMOT4SB challenge, which leverages temporal information to address limitations of single-frame detection. Our three main contributions are: (1) the SMOT4SB dataset, consisting of 211 UAV video sequences with 108,192 annotated frames under diverse real-world conditions, designed to capture motion entanglement where both camera and targets move freely in 3D; (2) SO-HOTA, a novel metric combining Dot Distance with HOTA to mitigate the sensitivity of IoU-based metrics to small displacements; and (3) a competitive MVA2025 challenge with 78 participants and 308 submissions, where the winning method achieved a 5.1x improvement over the baseline. This work lays a foundation for advancing SMOT in UAV scenarios with applications in bird strike avoidance, agriculture, fisheries, and ecological monitoring.
